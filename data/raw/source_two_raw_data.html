Undergraduate Students Association Council is funding complimentary access to The New York Times starting this summer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver a year following Financial Supports Commissioner Sara Broukhim\u0026#8217;s initial campaign promise to provide students access to the Times, the FSC has used approximately $31,000 in surplus funds to broker a year-long deal with the highly-circulated news organization. Students can \u003ca href=\"https://nytimesineducation.com/access-nyt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003esign up\u003c/a\u003e to receive access using their UCLA-affiliated email address through the 2023-2024 academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBroukhim, who is also a fourth-year cognitive science and political science student, said she felt Bruins should have access to the Times for classes and extracurricular research, as well as to limit the spread of misinformation among students. With many also facing financial barriers in paying for the service themselves, Broukhim said she wanted to support the undergraduate class with the necessary resources to stay fully informed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneral Representative 2 Gabby Lasry, who was also Broukhim’s chief of staff last year, said she feels a crucial component of the undergraduate educational experience is engaging with politics, the arts and the sciences, among other fields, which access to the Times supplies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Providing students with a free New York Times subscription was necessary to ensure that students have access to trusted information,” said Lasry, who is also a fourth-year political science student. “It\u0026#8217;s important for our students specifically to be \u0026#8230; well-informed on several issues, and for that, they need access to a reliable news source.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBroukhim, who approached the UCLA Library about this contract, said the Library already provides PDF articles for students, meaning they did not feel the need to provide the initiative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, Broukhim said she and other USAC representatives, including Lasry and General Representative 3 Jonathan Valenzuela Mejia, decided to work directly with a Times representative, because she said she still hoped to fund a full subscription to the Times. After applying for an estimated $40,000 from USAC originally, the deal was offered to UCLA for what essentially amounted to less than one dollar per undergraduate student, Broukhim said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValenzuela Mejia, who is also a fourth-year global studies and public affairs student, said interest in such a program subsidized by USAC has always been high, adding that members of USAC had looked into it in previous years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It started as an initiative from the (2020-2021) Office of the President at the time of the Naomi Riley administration,” he said. “I figured that that initiative had to go somewhere – I refused for it to die out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Broukhim said there may not be a guarantee that access will continue past next June because of uncertainty surrounding future funding. Every winter, a certain amount of surplus money will be allocated to the various initiatives that officers plan to sponsor, Valenzuela Mejia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUSAC is currently looking into more permanent sources to finance this initiative, Broukhim said, including working with other campus organizations or re-applying for surplus funding. Valenzuela Mejia said he would prefer to subsidize the cost as opposed to increasing student fees using the referendum process because he feels additional fees would unnecessarily financially burden students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the future, USAC also hopes to expand to options that include graduate students and faculty as well, Broukhim said. Should demand for other subscriptions arise, Broukhim added that they would consider working with other media outlets like the Wall Street Journal, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValenzuela Mejia said UCLA is among one of the later UC schools to obtain this deal, with UC Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz, UC San Diego and UC Irvine already offering Times subscriptions to students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;It’s one of the many ways that USAC is actively trying to hear its student population,” Valenzuela Mejia said. “This year in particular, the administration has been very centered on transparency, on accountability, as well as providing more resources to the student body overall – and I think this New York Times subscription is just one of the many ways that the student government is trying to expand its reach and support all facets of student life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis post was updated Oct. 9 at 10:57 p.m.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe Undergraduate Students Association Council is funding complimentary access to The New York Times starting this summer.\u003c/p\u003e\n","protected":false},"author":7145,"featured_media":449906,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"ngg_post_thumbnail":0},"categories":[1427,1424,1429],"tags":[],"acf":{"db_article_format":"default","db_number_of_paws":"0","corrections":"Correction: The original version of this article incorrectly stated that Jonathan Valenzuela Mejia is a fourth-year global studies and political science student.

Community Service Commission of the Undergraduate Students Association Council hosted the second annual Servocacy Fest on Wednesday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe afternoon event, which was held in Wilson Plaza, was designed to connect students with more than 35 volunteering and service-based organizations.

Students had opportunities to win tote bags, baseball caps and a free meal from a food truck, she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily Calkins, a fourth-year anthropology student, said she decided to learn more about volunteering at the event after benefiting from an emergency meal swipe program last year, which she later found was run by a UCLA student organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fair also helps connect organizations that are service oriented, said Mary Minasyan, a fourth-year astrophysics student.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliam Chao, a fourth-year political science student, said the event was important in providing information about how to get involved in public service as a UCLA student.

The event also included free giveaways of hats and ice cream along with live music and dancing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAstrid Colop, the program coordinator for First To Go, said the event was important in allowing first-generation college students to connect with people in similar circumstances as them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalya Venegas, a second-year cognitive science student who participated in a dance performance at the event, added that events like the first-generation soiree were important in connecting with people because they understand some of the things she is going through, such as navigating health insurance in college.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It helps build representation, and \u0026#8230; I get to meet other people who are also first-gen – it makes me feel like I\u0026#8217;m not alone,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVenegas said being in the first generation in her family to go to college was intimidating when she first started at UCLA, but she feels rewarded for her efforts because future generations in her family will look up to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was really hard, but at the same time, it\u0026#8217;s very rewarding, because at least I know that \u0026#8230; my little sister and if I have a kid, they can look up to me,” she said. “I\u0026#8217;m glad to be the first one in my family to go to college.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice Huang, a second-year cognitive science student who worked at the event, said she felt it is important to spread awareness about the need to celebrate first-generation students like her. She added that the event aims to connect students to resources they can use in college.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColop also said the event featured over 20 campus partners, including the Graduate Student Resource Center, the Undocumented Student Program, and Bruin Guardian Scholars, a program that provides resources for current and former foster youth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYahir Perez, a first-year business economics student, said he came to the event after hearing about it from a friend because he was curious about resources available to first-generation students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was interested to see the resources they have for people who are new to the whole college thing and who don\u0026#8217;t really have parents or don\u0026#8217;t really have older people to look up to, to ask for advice for college,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough some first-generation students sometimes feel awkward attempting to access resources, the event helped provide contact with the staff involved with them, building trust and making him more likely to use the resources, Perez said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome students at the event said their other lived experiences and identities – such as being a graduate student – intersect with their experience of being a first-generation student.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst-generation students who are graduate students and who are faculty are also often forgotten, Colop said, adding that she feels it\u0026#8217;s important that they are brought into conversations about the challenges first-generation students face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowshika Krishnan Bala, a graduate student who is also a first-generation student, said she has discovered significant cultural and academic differences since moving to the United States from India, including in lecturing styles and campus organization. She added that events aimed at getting to know other first-generation students are important to her as she is getting used to life at UCLA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0026#8217;ve just moved to the U.S.,” she said. “Academics here \u0026#8230; are different from what it used to be where I grew up, so it\u0026#8217;s important for me to meet other people who are going through a similar experience and maybe get resources that are specific to people who are new.”\u003c/p\u003e\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis post was updated Oct. 8 at 10:08 p.m.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe First To Go program hosted an event Wednesday for students in their family’s first generation to attend a four-year college.\u003c/p\u003e\n","protected":false},"author":7362,"featured_media":449755,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"ngg_post_thumbnail":0},"categories":[1425,1427,1424],"tags":[4850],"acf":{"db_article_format":"default","db_number_of_paws":"0","corrections":"","db_subhead":"","db_infobox":"","db_display_options":["mugshot"],"db_link":"","db_gallery_id":"","db_authoremail":"","db_feature":false,"db_feature_tag":"","db_feature_photoratio":"horizontal","db_sponsored_disclaimer":"This post was created by Bruin Media Group, the marketing section of the Daily Bruin.

The statement also said the pest problem could be caused by the move-in process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As with any apartment or housing unit, pests may at times get into the unit,” Housing said in the emailed statement. “Especially during times like move-in, when doors may be left open for extended periods of time, or luggage is being brought into units, there may be an increase of pests.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHousing also said it was possible that housekeeping accidentally missed a room or unit because of the relatively short transition period between summer and fall residents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHousing added that there is a comprehensive protocol for managing bedbug infestations, which includes a pest control inspection within two business days, treatment within the following three business days and temporary housing for residents during the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiu said she contacted her dorm’s front desk after she realized her room had bedbugs but was not provided with temporary housing until the following day. She added that Housing was generally communicative throughout the treatment process, but the front desk staff seemed initially confused about how to handle the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I personally think that they (Housing) were very organized,” she said. “The only complication that we had was that some of the front desk employees didn’t really understand how to process the bedbug situation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSalcido said he and his roommates had not yet contacted Housing about the ant infestation in their apartment at the time of his interview.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSalcido also said he expected his unit to have been cleaned more thoroughly before move-in with special attention to pest prevention procedures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Prior to students moving in on the first day, they probably should have sprayed for bugs or done whatever procedures they have in place for making sure pests don’t get into the building,” he said. “I would just prefer there be more initiative taken in getting rid of certain bugs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiu also said she expected more attention to cleanliness given the cost of university housing. Plaza triple dorms such as Siu’s can cost up to $17,784 per academic year, while two-bedroom university apartments such as Salcido’s cost up to $9,784 per year at Levering Terrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was \u0026#8230; very frustrated because we do have to pay a lot for housing,” Siu said. “I wish that they (Housing) had cleaned the rooms and the bedbugs before we moved in so we didn’t have to face this problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe added that her experience moving back and forth between her dorm and temporary housing was stressful and confusing because it was unclear what she was allowed to bring to the temporary room, and she didn’t receive help with the move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiu said the bedbug infestation in her dorm room also left her with anxiety about future pest problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“After the bedbug situation, I was worried about what other problems could arise in the future,” she said. “If I get bedbugs or carpet bugs again during an exam time, how am I going to deal with that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis post was updated Oct. 5 at 7:30 p.m.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nStudents encountered bedbugs, ants and other cleanliness issues when they moved into university housing this year.\u003cbr /\u003e\nSome residents in Hedrick Summit, Weyburn Terrace and Levering Heights have reported bedbugs, with students in Levering Terrace also discovering ant problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n","protected":false},"author":7457,"featured_media":449650,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"ngg_post_thumbnail":0},"categories":[1427,1424],"tags":[],"acf":{"db_article_format":"default","db_number_of_paws":"0","corrections":"","db_subhead":"","db_infobox":"","db_display_options":["mugshot"],"db_link":"","db_gallery_id":"","db_authoremail":"","db_feature":false,"db_feature_tag":"","db_feature_photoratio":"horizontal","db_sponsored_disclaimer":"This post was created by Bruin Media Group, the marketing section of the Daily Bruin.

p.m.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile a spoonful of sugar might help the medicine go down, that spoonful is also the secret to a year of good luck for first-year mechanical engineering student Rahul Nanda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike Nanda, many others embarked on unique practices or rituals Thursday as part of the first day of school. To combat mixed feelings about the start of classes, students said they have special outfits, playlists and rituals for the perfect first day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0026#8217;s a little overwhelming at first,” he said. “There\u0026#8217;s a lot of things being thrown at you, but it feels good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some first-year students, preparation is key for their first day of college. Sophia Rios, a first-year astrophysics student, said she eased into her first day by sitting with new friends from her morning class. She added that the first day of classes also helped ease her concerns about whether or not UCLA was right for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was very nervous,” she said, “But actually getting in, sitting down in the classes and meeting new people – it kind of went away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor other returning students, however, the key to the first day was planning the perfect outfit. Roxy Morris, a third-year film student, said she sends her mom a photo of her first-day outfit every year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicole Floum, a third-year biology student, said planning her outfit was actually the most important part of the day, adding that she takes longer than usual because the perfect outfit sets the tone for the day and the year. \u003cs\u003e\u003c/s\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorris added that making a nice breakfast and trying to get to class early are also key parts of her perfect first-day schedule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Year three is where the energy picks up again, a lot of new faces,” she said. “You have to make the most of it, so I feel I\u0026#8217;m just most excited for things to change.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther students said a key part of their first-day ritual is ensuring they are prepared for academic life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate de Guillenchmidt, a third-year neuroscience student, said while some students usually organize all folders and syllabi in preparation for the first day, she didn’t this year. De Guillenchmidt added that she felt underprepared for class compared to her peers but has started trying to get back into good habits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDe Guillenchmidt said she was very excited to be back but also anxious about starting classes because she took summer classes, meaning that she did not have a longer break from school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My brain has been on all year,” she said. “I am very excited and stressed, really – those are the two emotions for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJayson Tian, a second-year computer science student, said he met up for a coffee with an old high school friend, Nanda – who had just started at UCLA – to chat and give him advice on the college experience. He added that this set a positive tone for his first day back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanda added that since both he and Tian are from Toronto, playing music by Drake on the first day of classes was the perfect choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I actually lost my Airpods like two days ago,” he said. “But if I had still had them, I\u0026#8217;d probably play some Drake to remind myself of Toronto again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the first day is exciting for many, for fourth-year students, the first day of class – or the “last first day” – can also be a bittersweet event. Freddy Soto, a fourth-year political science transfer student, said he wants to make the most of his final year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoto said he likes to prepare his backpack and folders the day before so he is ready to go. But for Soto – who is a commuter student – the drive to school is just as crucial for preparation, he said, adding that he likes to play music that gets him excited for the day, such as rap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough Soto said he is excited to graduate and move on to the next stage of his life, he added that he hopes all students take advantage of their time at UCLA as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0026#8217;m going to say this for transfers and for first years: Definitely enjoy your time here because it flies by,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis post was updated Oct. 4 at 7:44 p.m.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nWhile a spoonful of sugar might help the medicine go down, that spoonful is also the secret to a year of good luck for first-year mechanical engineering student Rahul Nanda.\u003c/p\u003e\n","protected":false},"author":7430,"featured_media":449564,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"ngg_post_thumbnail":0},"categories":[1425,1427,1424],"tags":[],"acf":{"db_article_format":"default","db_number_of_paws":"0","corrections":"","db_subhead":"","db_infobox":"","db_display_options":["mugshot"],"db_link":"","db_gallery_id":"","db_authoremail":"","db_feature":false,"db_feature_tag":"","db_feature_photoratio":"horizontal","db_sponsored_disclaimer":"This post was created by Bruin Media Group, the marketing section of the Daily Bruin.
